<h1 align="center">MS3 Project - HeatSink</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://heatsink-flask-project.herokuapp.com/)

An online clothing shop wishes to move away from a popular web hosting and framework site to manage their site themselves. They have asked to design a new website that will modernise their existing site and provide them with the ability to manage and update the site themselves.

To facilitate the client, I am using the Django Framework to create a site that they can manage from the admin section. It was agreed to carry out the design and building of the site in various stages. The first stage is to get the framework up and running with a database to manipulate data relevant to sales, an account system to facilitate their existing and future users and a blog at a later stage. The first stage will see the design of the site and the beginning of the framework and backend. The next stage will incorporate more user profile creation and editing, along with further enhancements to sales features. The third stage will see the creation of a blog/community site for the registered users, where they can keep apprised of the latest news and events.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone6, iPad & Samsung Note 10+.
-   All menu links were tested across all pages to ensure that they all go to the correct page.
-   All of the buttons were tested, across all pages, to ensure that they go to the links specified or carried out the desired action.

### Known Bugs

-   The initial devices (setup for the company), previously configured, have been deployed and are working. The test device configured identically is not switching the relays. To complete the project, I have configured the heater button to simulate the action of the relay using the database. I have attached the code for the relays [here](https://github.com/rdylanward/HeatSink/blob/master/static/docs/relay.py). The installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/rdylanward/HeatSink/blob/master/static/docs/Configure_HeatSink_Automation_Hat.txt).

### Future Development

-   Resolve the issue with the switching the relays on the device and re-implement the remote access.
-   Add a mechanism to create and update schedules on the controllers.
-   Add a documentation page.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages
