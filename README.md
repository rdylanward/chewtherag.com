An online clothing shop wishes to move away from a popular web hosting and framework site to manage their site themselves. They have asked to design a new website that will modernise their existing site and provide them with the ability to manage and update the site themselves.

To facilitate the client, I am using the Django Framework to create a site that they can manage from the admin section. It was agreed to carry out the design and building of the site in various stages. The first stage is to get the framework up and running with a database to manipulate data relevant to sales, an account system to facilitate their existing and future users and a blog at a later stage. The first stage will see the design of the site and the beginning of the framework and backend. The next stage will incorporate more user profile creation and editing, along with further enhancements to sales features. The third stage will see the creation of a blog/community site for the registered users, where they can keep apprised of the latest news and events.

        -   Montserrat was chosen for its clean design and easy to read style. Sans Serif was chosen as the back-up in the event the main font does not load. the logo/brand incorporates Amatic SC (with cursive for backup). Amatic SC is used for the navigation 
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Implemented a fixed image related to the type of application this is. A dark filter is layered over the image to allow for the elements to stand out.

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://rdylanward.github.io/chewtherag.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) for a tutorial on the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://rdylanward.github.io/chewtherag.com/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://rdylanward.github.io/chewtherag.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://rdylanward.github.io/chewtherag.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
